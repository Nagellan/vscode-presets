# VSCode Spaces

**ATTENTION! An extension is currently under active development. Not usable yet.**

More than workspaces. Save presets of your workspaces and use them across many projects. \
Configure your workspace once, and save that configuration into Space. Space will contain the following settings:
* Workspace settings
* Set of extensions
* Color theme
* File icon theme
* Product icon theme
* Chosen configuration files (e.g. `.eslintrc`, `webpack.config`, `tsconfig`, etc)
* ...

> Actually, Space may contain the whole `VSCode > Preferences` configuration

Afterwards, you will be able to create workspaces out of your Space. Each workspace will contain all necessary configuration files, specific themes (colors, file icons, product icons), workspace settings. Moreover, a Space-specific set of extensions will be installed automatically, enabled workspace-only (ridding you from messing with an innumerable amount of installed ones enabled by default).

Finally, instead of a clean workspace, you will have a fully-configured one ready for further development from scratch or not. Community Spaces may save you even more time getting rid of from even configuring the workspace.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something
